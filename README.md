## About ReSimple
\tThis project was my first Capstone entry, built for the Python section of PDX Code Guild's Full Stack Bootcamp. I have hobbied in music production and sound design for years and have accumulated a massive folder of audio samples, the majority of which being .wav filetypes. The nature of collecting these files is that they often have strange casing, numerals, and filenames that have nothing to do with each other; even when they are from the same source. A folder of random free kick drum samples, that do NOT require attribution from the source, would be much more useful to me if they were simple labeled Kick Drum (1), Kick Drum (2), etc.  
After seeing what was capable with Python during that section of the course, I wanted to push my skills a bit further by delving into th **os** module and utilizing **Pyaudio** to play my files within the terminal. After successfully previewing the file contents, I wanted to rename all of the contents as a batch with a single filename and consecutive integer.
